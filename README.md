# Project template for AI-Assisted development

My battle-tested project template for working with AI coding assistants, refined over 12-18 months of AI-assisted development using Claude Code.

## What is this

This template encapsulates patterns and workflows that have consistently delivered results for me when building software with AI assistants like Claude Code. It's opinionated, practical, and designed to minimise friction while maximising collaboration quality.

## Core Principles

**Lifecycle-based documentation** - Documents move through clear stages (SPECIFICATIONS → REFERENCE → ARCHIVE), keeping active context minimal and focused.

**Tests as guardrails** - Tests serve dual purposes: validation as well as directional context for AI driven changes and refinements. They guide how to evolve a build, not just verify it works.

**Token efficiency** - CLAUDE.md files act as "library indexes" that lazy-load context only when needed. My assumption is that this makes token usage more efficient, and leads to better results.

**Collaboration framework** - Clear behavioral guidelines for working with AI (directness over politeness, evidence-based pushback, systematic decision-making). Collaboration mode support for "product management" style work as well as software development.

**Systematic over ad-hoc** - Consistent patterns (PR reviews, phased implementation structure, testing strategy) that compound over time.

## What's inside

## If you want to try using this as a template

1. **Use this template** (click "Use this template" button on GitHub)
2. **Follow setup guide** - See [TEMPLATE-INSTRUCTIONS.md](./TEMPLATE-INSTRUCTIONS.md)
3. **Customize for your project** - Replace placeholders with your details
4. **Start building** - Break project into phases, work systematically

## Why did I end up here...

After 12-18 months of LLM-assisted coding, a few things became clear:

- **AI assistants are coworkers, not servants** - Best results come from treating them as collaborators with domain expertise
- **Documentation is leverage** - Good docs enable both AI and humans to pick up work quickly, context matters
- **Tests guide better than specs alone** - Especially with AI, detailed specifications and ways of working mitigate drift
- **Simple beats clever** - Patterns that are easy to explain work better than complex optimization
- **Consistency compounds** - Using the same structure across projects builds muscle memory (yours and the AI's)

## Technology defaults

These are my preferences that I tend to reuse for all projects I dive into. YMMV, so if you try this template you should carefully review this section and make it yours.

TypeScript, Next.js, Cloudflare Workers, Supabase, Vitest - but easily customizable. See `.claude/COLLABORATION/technology-preferences.md` for rationale.
