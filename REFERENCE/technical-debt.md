Tracks known limitations, shortcuts, and deferred improvements in the codebase.
Items here are accepted risks or pragmatic choices made during development, not bugs.

## Active technical debt

*(No items yet - will be added as the project is built)*

---

### Example Format: TD-001: Description
- **Location:** `src/path/to/file.ts` - `functionName()`
- **Issue:** Clear description of the limitation or shortcut
- **Why accepted:** Reason for accepting this debt (e.g., runtime constraints, time pressure, lack of alternative)
- **Risk:** Low/Medium/High - Impact assessment
- **Future fix:** Proposed solution when time/resources allow
- **Phase introduced:** Phase number when this was added

## Resolved items

*(Move items here when addressed, with resolution notes)*

---

## Notes

- Items are prefixed TD-NNN for easy reference in code comments and PR reviews
- When adding new debt, include: location, issue description, why accepted, risk level, and proposed future fix
- Review this list at the start of each development phase to see if any items should be addressed
- Low-risk items can remain indefinitely; High-risk items should be addressed within 2-3 phases
